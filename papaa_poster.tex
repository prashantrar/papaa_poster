\headerbox{Background and Motivation}{name=problem,column=0,row=0}{
Accelerator Design Productivity Issues:
%Major issues in mainstream adoption of FPGAs:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt
\item Difficulty of accelerator design at low level
\item Complex Host-Accelerator interfacing 
\item Lack of software like abstractions 
\item Long compilation times (Place and route)
\end{itemize}
One solution: High Level Synthesis (HLS)
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt
\item Accelerator design in a high level language
\item Automated host-accelerator interfacing
\item RTL generation from C/C++/OpenCL
\item Benefits of software like abstractions 
\item SDSoC, \textbf{AOCL}, SDAccel
\item Long compilation time still an issue
\end{itemize}
Coarse-Grained FPGA Overlays:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt
\item Fast compilation and development cycles	
\item Easy to use even by novice programmers
\item Access of FPGA for software developers	
\item \textbf{MXP}, GRVI-Phalanx, DeCO, DySER
\end{itemize}
}



\headerbox{Contributions}{name=scgra,column=0,below=problem}{
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt
	\item Analysis of Overlay architectures like Vectorblox MXP and Altera OpenCL SDK as alternatives to pure RTL design flow. Highlighting the ease of use and fast learning curves of these methods.
	\item Benchmarking and comparison of timing performance as well as operations per cycle for the Vectorblox MXP processor and the Altera OpenCL Implementation with arm CPU implementation.
\end{itemize}


}



\headerbox{Observations}{name=analysis, column=0,below=scgra}{
The Vectorblox MXP soft vector processor:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt
	\item Extremely short learning curve
	\item Easy to use MXP C/C++ APIs 
%	\item Full control of DMA and execution to programmer
	\item Compilation and debugging time equal to that of traditional C/C++ debugging
\end{itemize}
The Altera OpenCL SDK:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt
	\item Minimal modification of traditional OpenCL code required
	\item Kernel optimizations like vectorization, hardware replication for parallelism
%	\item FPGA reconfiguration at runtime with new kernel
	\item Host code portability across all devices
\end{itemize}	
	

}



\headerbox{Conclusions and Future Work}{name=conclusion,column=0,below=analysis,above=bottom}{
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt
	\item More popularity of overlays and high level synthesis tools
	\item Place and route effeciency improvements in OpenCL to hardware
	\item Overall generated hardware effeciency improvment
	\item More awareness in the software world and amongst software developers
\end{itemize}

\headerbox{The Vectorblox MXP Processor}{name=designmethod,column=1,row=0}{ 
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt
	\item Accelerating Bare metal C/C++ applications on Zynq using MXP
	\item Easy to use software APIs for embedded vector processing
	\item 16 vector lanes each containing an ALU
	\item Good for integer operations, lacks floating point
