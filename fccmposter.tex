\headerbox{Background and Motivation}{name=problem,column=0,row=0}{
Major issues in mainstream adoption of FPGAs:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt
\item Difficulty of accelerator design at low level
\item Long compilation times (Place and route)
\item Poor design productivity
\end{itemize}
One possible solution is to use FPGA Overlay:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt
	\item Accelerator design in a high level language
	\item Fast compilation and development cycles	
	\item Easy to use even by novice programmers
	\item Puts the FPGA in the hands of software developers.	
\end{itemize}
Another solution is to use novel high level synthesis tools:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt
\item HLS tools to generate C to RTL, eg:Vivado HLS, SDSoC
\item OpenCL to hardware design synthesis eg:AOCL, SDAccel
\end{itemize}
}



\headerbox{Contributions}{name=scgra,column=0,below=problem}{
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt
	\item Analysis of Overlay architectures like Vectorblox MXP and Altera OpenCL SDK as alternatives to pure RTL design flow. Highlighting the ease of use and fast learning curves of these methods.
	\item Benchmarking and comparison of timing performance as well as operations per cycle for the Vectorblox MXP processor and the Altera OpenCL Implementation with arm CPU implementation.
\end{itemize}


}



\headerbox{Observations}{name=analysis, column=0,below=scgra}{
The Vectorblox MXP soft vector processor:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt
	\item Extremely short learning curve
	\item The Vectorblox MXP C/C++ api is extremely easy to use.
	\item Full control of DMA and execution to programmer.
	\item Compilation and debugging time equal to that of traditional C/C++ debugging.
\end{itemize}
The Altera OpenCL SDK:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt
	\item Minimal modification of traditional OpenCL code required.
	\item kernel optimizations like vectorization, hardware replication for parallelism.
	\item Dynamic re-programming of FPGA at runtime with totally new kernel.
	\item Host code portability across all devices. 
\end{itemize}	
	

}



\headerbox{Conclusions and Future Work}{name=conclusion,column=0,below=analysis,above=bottom}{
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt
	\item More popularity of overlays and high level synthesis tools.
	\item Place and route effeciency improvements in OpenCL to hardware.
	\item Overall generated hardware effeciency improvment.
	\item More awareness in the software world and amongst software developers.
\end{itemize}

\headerbox{Efficient Overlay Architecture}{name=designmethod,column=1,row=0}{
2D array of tiles: 
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip0pt
	\item Programmable functional unit (FU) and routing resources in each tile
	\item Functional units interconnected via an island-style routing network
	\item Coarse grained switch boxes, connection boxes and routing channels as programmable routing resources
	\item Customizable channel width (CW), number of tracks in a routing channel%, for varying routability requirements% but at a higher area cost.
